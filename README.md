🎧 Console Jukebox: A CLI Music Player 🎧
A robust, Java-based command-line interface (CLI) music player built for performance and simplicity. Manage your local music library entirely through text commands—perfect for backend enthusiasts.


✨ Features
This project focuses on delivering core music player functionality via a smooth, responsive command-line experience:
🎹 Full Playback Control: Use simple commands to play, stop, pause, and resume audio tracks.
⏩ Navigation: Instantly forward or backward through tracks in your playlist.
🔍 Music Search: Dynamically search your loaded music directory for specific songs by title or artist.
📂 Playlist Management: Automatically generates a playlist from a specified local directory.
⚙️ Robust Backend Logic: Built purely in Java, focusing on reliable file handling and audio stream management.
🚀 Getting Started
To run this jukebox locally, you'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Prerequisites
Java JDK (Version 11+ Recommended)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone github.com
cd YourRepoName
Use code with caution.

Compile the Java source files:
bash
javac Main.java 
# (or use a build tool like Maven/Gradle if implemented)
Use code with caution.

Run the application:
bash
java Main
Use code with caution.

🕹️ Usage
Once the application starts, you will interact with it using simple commands:
Command	Description	Example

🔧 Technical Stack
Language: Java
Audio Handling: Java Sound API (javax.sound.sampled)
Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)
💡 Learnings & Development Focus
This project was a deep dive into several key backend engineering concepts:
File I/O & Audio Streams: Mastering how Java interacts with the local file system and manages continuous audio data streams efficiently.
Concurrency: Implementing multithreading to ensure the user input listener remains active without interrupting the ongoing audio playback process.
OOP Principles: Applying clean Object-Oriented Programming patterns to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
